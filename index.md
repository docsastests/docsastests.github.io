When product updates are frequent and user expectations are high, maintaining accurate and up-to-date documentation isn’t just a necessity—it's a competitive advantage.

Docs as Tests is a strategy that keeps your docs in sync with your product. It's a way to test your docs, just like engineers test their code. It's a way to make sure that your docs are always accurate, complete, and relevant.

- Validate that your guides, tutorials, API references, and other docs work as written.
- Catch issues in your docs and product---before your users do.
- Reduce the time and effort required to maintain your docs.
- Build user trust by ensuring a consistent user experience between your docs and product.
- Make docs a first-class citizen in your engineering and product development processes.

By testing your doc content against your product UIs and APIs, directly navigating your websites and hitting your API endpoints, you can ensure that your docs are always accurate, complete, and relevant.

With the right [tools](/tools), Docs as Tests can elevate your docs to a dynamic, living part of your product. Interested? You're in the right place.
