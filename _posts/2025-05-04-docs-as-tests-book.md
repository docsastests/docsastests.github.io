# Docs as Tests book is Now Available!

I'm thrilled to announce that my book, "Docs as Tests: A Strategy for Resilient Technical Documentation" is now available! After years of developing this approach at companies like Skyflow and sharing it with the documentation community, I've created a comprehensive guide to help technical writers and developers keep documentation accurate and in sync with products.

## What You'll Learn

_Docs as Tests_ introduces a powerful strategy that treats documentation as testable assertions about how your product works. By implementing automated testing for your documentation, you can:

- Catch documentation issues before your users do
- Maintain accurate screenshots, API examples, and code snippets
- Build user trust through consistently reliable documentation
- Reduce support costs and improve user experience

The book covers testing approaches for all major product interfaces:
- GUIs (web and native applications)
- APIs (REST, GraphQL, AsyncAPI)
- Command-line interfaces
- Code examples and SDK documentation
